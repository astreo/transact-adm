## How to set up and run/test the app

Download the app and run 'npm install'.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.<br/>
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.<br/>

## Application structure

1 Component (transactions), which has the html, ts, css and the search pipe.<br/>
1 Model file, containing all the interfaces needed to work with the incomming data when instatiated.<br/>
1 Service file, to mock the get request for the transaction list (using the included json file)<br/>
